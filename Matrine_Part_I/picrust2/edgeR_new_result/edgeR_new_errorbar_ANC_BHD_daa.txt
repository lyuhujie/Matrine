NHEJ involves binding of the KU heterodimer to double-stranded DNA ends, recruitment of DNA-PKcs (MRX complex in yeast), processing of ends, and recruitment of the DNA ligase IV (LIG4)-XRCC4 complex, which brings about ligation. A recent study shows that bacteria accomplish NHEJ using just two proteins (Ku and DNA ligase), whereas eukaryotes require many factors. NHEJ repairs DSBs at all stages of the cell cycle, bringing about the ligation of two DNA DSBs without the need for sequence homology, and so is error-prone.

Penicillins are produced only by fungi, while cephalosporins (including cephamycins) are produced by fungi and bacteria. Both antibiotics are synthesized from L-2-aminoadipate, L-cysteine and L-valine through a common pathway. It starts with the condensation of these three amino acids by the non-ribosomal peptide synthetase to form the tripeptide delta-(L-2-aminoadipyl)-L-cysteinyl-D-valine (ACV). The linear ACV tripeptide is then converted to bicyclic isopenicillin N by isopenicillin N synthase, in which the beta-lactam ring is formed. Isopenicillin N is the branch point of penicillin [MD:M00672] and cephalosporin [MD:M00673] pathways.

The parasite life cycle involves hematophagous reduviid bugs as vectors. Once parasites enter the host body, they invade diverse host cells including cardiomyocytes. Establishment of infection depends on various parasite molecules such as cruzipain, oligopeptidase B, and trans-sialidase that activate Ca2+ signaling. Internalized parasites escape from the parasitophorous vacuole using secreted pore-forming TcTOX molecule and replicate in the cytosol. Multiplied parasites eventually lyse infected host cells and are released in the circulation. During these events, the parasites manipulate host innate immunity and elicit cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. T lymphocyte responses are also disturbed.	Human Diseases; Infectious disease: parasitic	Chagas disease

The carbohydrates that we ingest vary from the lactose in milk to complex carbohydrates. These carbohydrates are digested to monosaccharides, mostly glucose, galactose and fructose, prior to absorption in the small intestine. Glucose and galactose are initially transported into the enterocyte by SGLT1 located in the apical brush border membrane and then exit through the basolateral membrane by either GLUT2 or exocytosis. In a new model of intestinal glucose absorption, transport by SGLT1 induces rapid insertion and activation of GLUT2 in the brush border membrane by a PKC betaII-dependent mechanism. Moreover, trafficking of apical GLUT2 is rapidly up-regulated by glucose and artificial sweeteners, which act through T1R2 + T1R3/alpha-gustducin to activate PLC-beta2 and PKC-beta II. Fructose is transported separately by the brush border GLUT5 and then released out of the enterocyte into the blood by GLUT2.

Small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) is a highly aggressive neoplasm, which accounts for approximately 25% of all lung cancer cases. Molecular mechanisms altered in SCLC include induced expression of oncogene, MYC, and loss of tumorsuppressor genes, such as p53, PTEN, RB, and FHIT. The overexpression of MYC proteins in SCLC is largely a result of gene amplification. Such overexpression leads to more rapid proliferation and loss of terminal differentiation. Mutation or deletion of p53 or PTEN can lead to more rapid proliferation and reduced apoptosis. The retinoblastoma gene RB1 encodes a nuclear phosphoprotein that helps to regulate cell-cycle progression. The fragile histidine triad gene FHIT encodes the enzyme diadenosine triphosphate hydrolase, which is thought to have an indirect role in proapoptosis and cell-cycle control.

It results from various etiologies, both noninfectious and infectious, but coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) is still considered the dominant etiological agent. Myocarditis may be caused by direct cytopathic effects of virus, a pathologic immune response to persistent virus, or autoimmunity triggered by the viral infection. The virus enters the myocyte through internalization of the coxsackie-adenoviral receptor (CAR) and its coreceptor, decay-accelerating factor (DAF). Viral proteases cleave various proteins in the host cell. One example is viral protease 2A, which cleaves eukaryote initiation factor 4G (eIF4G) and the dystrophin protein, resulting in a complete shutdown of cap-dependent RNA translation and cytoskeletal destruction in infected cardiomyocytes, respectively. CVB3 also cleaves the member of the Bcl-2 family Bid, leading to apoptosis. CVB3 infection also induces the cleavage of cyclin D protein through a proteasome-dependent pathway, leading to the host cell-growth arrest. Viral infection and necrosis of myocytes may lead to the release of intracellular antigens, resulting in activation of self-reactive T cells. CVB infection is a significant cause of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) as well as myocarditis. Epidemiologically, myocarditis underlies a significant portion of patients with DCM.

In the tubular lumen, filtered HCO3(-) combines with H(+) in a reaction catalyzed by CA IV. The CO2 thus produced rapidly diffuses into the tubular cells and is combined with water to produce intracellular H(+) and HCO3(-), catalyzed by soluble cytoplasmic CA II. HCO3(-) is then cotransported with Na(+) into blood via the NBC-1. The intracellular H(+) produced by CA II is secreted into the tubular lumen predominantly via the NHE-3. The PT creates the "new HCO3(-)" by taking glutamine and metabolizing it to two molecules each of NH4(+) and HCO3(-). The NH4(+) is excreted into the tubular lumen, and the HCO3(-) , which is "new HCO3(-) ," is returned to the blood, where it replaces the HCO3(-) lost earlier in the titration of nonvolatile acids.

CRC arises from the colorectal epithelium as a result of the accumulation of genetic alterations in defined oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes (TSG). Two major mechanisms of genomic instability have been identified in sporadic CRC progression. The first, known as chromosomal instability (CIN), results from a series of genetic changes that involve the activation of oncogenes such as K-ras and inactivation of TSG such as p53, DCC/Smad4, and APC. The second, known as microsatellite instability (MSI), results from inactivation of the DNA mismatch repair genes MLH1 and/or MSH2 by hypermethylation of their promoter, and secondary mutation of genes with coding microsatellites, such as transforming growth factor receptor II (TGF-RII) and BAX. Hereditary syndromes have germline mutations in specific genes (mutation in the tumour suppressor gene APC on chromosome 5q in FAP, mutated DNA mismatch repair genes in HNPCC).

Melanogenesis is under complex regulatory control by multiple agents. The most important positive regulator of melanogenesis is the MC1 receptor with its ligands melanocortic peptides. MC1R activates the cyclic AMP (cAMP) response-element binding protein (CREB). Increased expression of MITF and its activation by phosphorylation (P) stimulate the transcription of tyrosinase (TYR), tyrosinase-related protein 1 (TYRP1), and dopachrome tautomerase (DCT), which produce melanin. Melanin synthesis takes place within specialized intracellular organelles named melanosomes.

It is capable of degrading a variety of cellular proteins in a rapid and timely fashion and most substrate proteins are modified by ubiquitin before their degradation by the proteasome. The proteasome is a large protein complex consisting of a proteolytic core called the 20S particle and ancillary factors that regulate its activity in various ways. The most common form is the 26S proteasome containing one 20S core particle and two 19S regulatory particles that enable the proteasome to degrade ubiquitinated proteins by an ATP-dependent mechanism. Another form is the immunoproteasome containing two 11S regulatory particles, PA28 alpha and PA28 beta, which are induced by interferon gamma under the conditions of intensified immune response. Other regulatory particles include PA28 gamma and PA200. Although PA28 gamma also belongs to a family of activators of the 20S proteasome, it is localized within the nucleus and forms a homoheptamer. PA28 gamma has been implicated in the regulation of cell cycle progression and apoptosis. PA200 has been identified as a large nuclear protein that stimulates proteasomal hydrolysis of peptides.

The tachyzoite form acquired by oral ingestion downmodulates proinflammatory signaling pathways via various mechanisms. During early infection, nuclear translocation of NFkB is temporally blocked and p38 MAPK phosphorylation is prevented, suppressing IL-12 production. Another pathway for IL-12 induction occurs through CCR5 dependent pathway, but parasitic induction of an eicosanoid LXA4 contributes to the downregulation of IL-12. Direct activation of STAT3 by the parasite enhance anti-inflammatory function of IL-10 and TGF beta.

These pathogenic mutations and environmental factors are known to cause disease due to oxidative stress, intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis impairment, mitochondrial dysfunctions and altered protein handling compromising key roles of DA neuronal function and survival. The demise of DA neurons located in the SNc leads to a drop in the dopaminergic input to the striatum, which is hypothesized to impede movement by inducing hypo and hyper activity in striatal spiny projection neurons (SPNs) of the direct (dSPNs) and indirect (iSPNs) pathways in the basal ganglia, respectively.

At meiosis I, one pair of sister chromatids recombines with, then segregates from, its homologous pair, while the sister chromatids segregate from each other at meoisis II. In yeast, the switch to enter growth phase or meiosis phase is controlled by nutritional signals. At the onset of meiosis, nutritional signaling pathways converge on transcriptional regulation of Ime1. Ime1 is a transcriptional activator to promote expression of early meiosis-specific genes required for pre-meiotic DNA replication and meiotic recombination. Two of the early meiosis-specific genes, a transcriptional activator, Ndt80, and a CDK2 homolog, Ime2, are required for the transcription of middle meiosis-specific genes, which includes B-type cyclin genes and genes involved in spore wall formation. Polo-like kinase Cdc5, whose expression is activated by Ndt80, is required for the critical step in meiotic progression. Cdc5 regulates sister-kinetochore co-orientation by promoting the localization of Mam1 and Lrs4, components of the co-orientation complex, to kinetochores. Cdc5 also phosphorylates the meiotic cohesin subunit Rec8, which is essential for its cleavage and removal by separase. Moreover, Cdc5 promotes the release of protein phosphatase Cdc14 from the nuclezus, which is required for anaphase I spindle disassembly and exit from meiosis I. The centromeric protein Sgo1 is a key regulator of meiotic chromosome segregation. Sgo1 with PP2A may protect pericentromeric but not arm cohesion of sister chromatids during meiosis I. Sgo1 then disappears at meiosis II to allow sister chromatids to separate.	Cellular Processes; Cell growth and death	Meiosis - yeast
